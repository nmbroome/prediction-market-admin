# Prophet: Prediction Market Platform

## Project Overview

Prophet is a web-based prediction market platform where users can trade on the outcomes of future events. The platform uses automated market makers to facilitate trading and price discovery without requiring traditional order books.

## Key Features

### Binary Markets
Users can create and trade on binary outcome markets (typically Yes/No questions):
1. Users choose a market and select an outcome (e.g., "Yes" or "No")
2. Users specify how much they want to spend
3. The CPMM algorithm calculates how many outcome shares they receive
4. If the chosen outcome occurs, shares are worth $1 each; if not, they're worth $0
5. When events resolve, market creators can select the winning outcome and users' positions are settled accordingly

### Automated Market Making
Uses Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) algorithm to determine prices:
- The product of token pools remains constant (x * y = k)
- Trades change the ratio between token pools, which changes the price
- The market maker automatically adjusts prices based on supply and demand

### Additional Features
- **User Authentication**: Complete login/signup flow with Supabase authentication
- **User Profiles**: Personal dashboards showing trading history and portfolio performance
- **Market Creation**: Interface for users to create new prediction markets
- **Market Browsing**: Ability to view and filter available markets

- [ ] Forecasting analytics https://forecastapp.substack.com/p/whos-best-at-predicting-the-future
  - [ ] F-score give more weight to false positives and false negatives, whereas others, like area under curve measure accuracy as an integral of predicted performance in a two-dimensional space.
  - [ ] accuracy is the number of times you got a forecast right over the number of forecasts you made; your precision is how many times you correctly predicted Yes over the total number of Yeses you predicted; your recall is the number of times you correctly predicted Yes over the number of questions you forecasted that settled Yes. Related concepts, but all of them measure slightly different things.
  - [ ] Brier Score metrics don’t work for measuring user skill because Forecast doesn’t capture your predicted probability of an outcome - we only know your minimum predicted probability of the outcome. When you Buy the Yes for 25 points, we don’t know if you believe the probability is 30% or 90%, just that it’s greater than 25%.
